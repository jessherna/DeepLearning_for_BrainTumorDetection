# Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust deep learning-based system for the automated detection of brain tumors using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans. By leveraging various machine learning approaches including supervised, unsupervised, and state-of-the-art deep learning models, we seek to create an accurate and reliable diagnostic tool that can assist medical professionals.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection dataset available on Kaggle:
[Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection/code)

This dataset contains MRI scans of the brain, categorized into:
- MRI scans with tumors
- MRI scans without tumors

## Methodologies
Our approach encompasses multiple deep learning and machine learning paradigms:

### Supervised Learning Models
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Transfer Learning with pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet)
- Ensemble methods

### Unsupervised Learning Approaches
- Autoencoders for anomaly detection
- Clustering techniques for pattern discovery
- Dimensionality reduction methods

### State-of-the-Art Models
- Vision Transformers (ViT)
- Advanced segmentation models (U-Net, V-Net)
- Self-supervised learning approaches
